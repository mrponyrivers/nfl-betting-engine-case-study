# NFL POWERBOOK — Professional Betting Engine (Case Study)

A public **case study** of a professional-grade NFL betting workflow engine I built (“NFL POWERBOOK”).
This repo showcases **workflow engineering, automation, and evaluation** while keeping sensitive/proprietary components private.

**What this case study demonstrates**
- Live odds ingestion → normalization → implied probability
- Model probability vs market probability
- Expected Value (EV) + Kelly stake sizing
- CLV tracking + bet logging + settlement history
- Reproducible weekly workflow and clean exports

## Why I built it

I wanted a system that treats betting as a **pricing + risk + process** problem:
- not just “pick the better team”
- but **consistently identify mispriced lines**, size stakes responsibly, and evaluate performance over time.

This project is also a strong example of what I enjoy building as an **AI Workflow Engineer**: turning messy real-world inputs into reliable outputs (structured data, exports, repeatable runs).

## Core features

### Odds pipeline
- Ingest live sportsbook odds (moneyline/spread/totals)
- Normalize into a consistent “master feed”
- Convert odds → implied probability

### Model + decisioning
- Compare model probabilities to market implied probabilities
- Compute EV (edge) and flag value opportunities
- Recommend stake sizing with Kelly (or fractional Kelly)

### Tracking + evaluation
- Bet log ledger
- Settlement outputs (win/loss, units, ROI)
- CLV (Closing Line Value) tracking to measure whether bets beat the market
